<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>I’m now <b>20 years old</b> and I still don’t know what my skills are.<sup>1</sup> Maybe being a hard worker is my skill? Is that even a skill?<sup>2</sup> I don't have anything particular that I’m good 
    at, maybe I’m mediocre at best on things that I do.<sup>3</sup> I have a basic understanding of <i>computer programming</i> and I have decent knowledge about <i>computer hardware.</i><sup>4</sup> I have leadership 
    skills, as I can take initiative and guide others when needed.<sup>5</sup> I have <i>problem-solving abilities</i> and willingness to learn.<sup>6</sup> I think one of my skills is <i>critical thinking.</i><sup>7</sup> I can 
    analyze situations logically and make well-informed decisions.<sup>8</sup> I don’t just accept information at face value, I like to question things and break them down to understand how 
    they work.<sup>9</sup> Whether it’s troubleshooting a technical issue or evaluating different solutions to a problem, I try to think critically to find the best possible outcome.<sup>10</sup> I also 
    have good <i>communication skills,</i> it allows me to express my thoughts clearly and collaborate effectively with others.<sup>11</sup> I also have decent <i>gaming skills</i> because of the allotted 
    time I played the game. Sometimes while playing games, I feel like I’m so good at it.<sup>12</sup> Sometimes I feel like I suck.<sup>13</sup> I am detail-oriented, making sure to pay attention to small 
    but important aspects of a task.<sup>14</sup> Even though I sometimes feel like I’m not particularly skilled in any one area, I know that my ability to learn and improve will help me develop 
    my strengths over time.<sup>15</sup> Maybe I just need more experience to truly realize what I’m capable of.<sup>16</sup> I will continue to expand my skill set and also improve my existing skills.<sup>17</sup> Another 
    skill I have is <i>creativity</i>.<sup>18</sup> I enjoy thinking outside the box and coming up with new ideas.<sup>19</sup> I know how to play the guitar, which allows me to express myself through music.<sup>20</sup></p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p><b>Hobbies</b>, I have a lot of hobbies throughout my life.<sup>1</sup> I watched shows in my free time since I was a kid, and I still do it whenever I want to relax.<sup>2</sup> I played basketball when I was little, 
    but now I rarely play it.<sup>3</sup> I also like <i>playing games</i>, whether it's an online game or a physical game.<sup>4</sup> I got absorbed by playing online games, and that's also part of the reason why I 
    chose an I.T. course.<sup>5</sup> I got curious about how games are made, and I also would like to make my own games in the future.<sup>6</sup> I also loved drawing when I was a kid.<sup>7</sup> I used to sketch random 
    things in my notebook, and sometimes, I would even try to copy characters from my favorite shows.<sup>8</sup> I enjoyed <i>reading books</i>, especially adventure and fantasy stories, because they allowed 
    me to imagine different worlds.<sup>9</sup> Although I don’t read as much now, I still appreciate a good story.<sup>10</sup> I also tried learning how to play the guitar, but I never got too serious about it.<sup>11</sup> 
    Still, I find music enjoyable, and I listen to it for hours, especially when I need to focus or just want to clear my mind.<sup>12</sup> <i>Video editing</i> is something I got into as well.<sup>13</sup> I like 
    experimenting with different effects, transitions, and audio to make my videos more engaging.<sup>14</sup> Designing is another thing I enjoy, which is why I like using Canva to create simple posters, 
    thumbnails, and other visuals.<sup>15</sup> I also tried cooking.<sup>16</sup> I find it fun to experiment with different recipes.<sup>17</sup> Though I’m not an expert, I like the process of making food and trying 
    new flavors.<sup>18</sup> There are times when I just enjoy doing nothing, simply lying down and letting my mind wander.<sup>19</sup> Even though I have a lot of hobbies, I always find myself going back to playing 
    games because it’s something I never get tired of.<sup>20</sup></p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>My interest in things varies from what I’m doing at the point of my life.<sup>1</sup> When I was in high school, I was interested in joining our <i>drum and lyre band</i> in our school.<sup>2</sup> After I joined, 
    I was interested in drumming and getting better and better.<sup>3</sup> When I was in grade school, my interest was towards <i>anime and learning Japanese.</i><sup>4</sup> I used to watch a lot of anime and even 
    tried to memorize common Japanese phrases.<sup>5</sup> When I was in high school, my interest was in <b>online games</b> like <i>League of Legends</i> because it was so fun to play.<sup>6</sup> I spent a lot of time

    how different lines of code could create something functional and interactive.<sup>12</sup> At some point, I got interested in going to the gym because I wanted to get stronger and be more active.<sup>13</sup>

    too serious about it.<sup>16</sup> I also got into watching esports tournaments, especially for games that I play, because I like seeing high-level gameplay and learning from professionals.<sup>17</sup> At some 
    point, I was also interested in creating content, like making gameplay videos or short edits, just for fun.<sup>18</sup> My interests always change depending on what I’m into at the moment, but I
